description: "Why this AI blog exists and what I'm building with it."
---

This site is my running logbook for:

- **AI tools** I actually use in day-to-day work and side projects  
- **Automation pipelines** that make money, save time, or both  
- **Homelab and networking experiments**, including everything that breaks along the way  

I’m a field service technician who lives in the real world of busted gear, weird networks, and non-theoretical problems.
This blog is where I turn that chaos into something **repeatable** and **useful**.

If you're into AI + infra + automation, you're in the right place.
