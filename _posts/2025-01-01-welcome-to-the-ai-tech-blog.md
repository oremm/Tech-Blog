title: "Welcome to the AI Tech Blog"
description: "What this site is, who it's for, and how I use AI + automation in real life."
tags: [ai, automation, homelab]

This blog is where I document **real-world experiments** with:

- AI tools and agents that actually save time or make money  
- Automation pipelines that glue together boring services into something useful  
- Homelab, networking gear, and the random chaos that comes with running your own stack  

The goal is simple:

> Turn "messy notes that live in my head" into **repeatable systems** that someone else can copy.

New posts will be added as Markdown files inside the `_posts` folder.
As soon as you push to GitHub, GitHub Pages rebuilds the site automatically.
